1.Project Description

I have created this Ecommerce site for books using Asp.net core MVC, 
This is just a personal project and my first full stack server side application,
I have integrated a lot of features including stripe, facebook login etc and handled the database
using DOTNET EF core, used SQL SERVER as Database.

2.Motivation
I wanted to test my c# skill and learn about the backend as well so i decided to do it by making a project.
I had an experience in frontend Angular17 but also wanted to build the SSR application from the scratch.
It was a complete challenge in it self as I made this project in Ubuntu which means I could not get the 
benefit of Visual Studio 2022. 
At the end it was a pleasant experience.

3.How to run the project

You can pull the entire repository in you local directory and run it but this project cannot run on Ubuntu
22.04 and above as the SQL server is not available for the Ubuntu 22.04 and above.
So, in order to run this project you have to run the SQL server in docker if you have the OS above 22.04.
